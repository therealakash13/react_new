      The real power of React components comes from composition and reusability.
      Components can receive data through props, manage their own state using
      hooks, and be combined together to build complex interfaces from simple
      parts. This approach makes applications easier to reason about, test, and
      scale, since changes in one component don’t ripple unpredictably through
      the entire codebase. In essence, React components turn UI development into
      a process of assembling well-defined, predictable pieces—much like
      building with LEGO blocks.
